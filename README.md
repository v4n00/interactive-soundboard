# Requirements

The deadline for choosing a project was met on October 15th. The final assignments can be found in the attached file. The symbols:
- <span style="color:lightgreen;">light green - you chose the project theme yourself and it's approved</span>
- <span style="color:orange;">light orange - you did not choose the project team yourself, so one theme was randomly assigned to you</span>
- <span style="color:orangered">dark orange - you written your name on a specific theme, but added a comment with another theme. The assigned theme is the one on column B</span>
## A few considerations on the development of the project

Use **Visual Studio Code & Live Server** to make development easier.  
The projects must contain at least 2 of the following APIs:
- **Canvas (mandatory)**
- **Audio API**
- Speech API
- Video API
- MIDI API
- Geolocation API
- **Drag & Drop API**

## Other Requirements
  
- **Adding Bootstrap to your project is mandatory**
- You are **not allowed** to use any external libraries apart from [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/), [jQuery](https://jquery.com/) and [Leaflet](https://leafletjs.com/) (for projects involving a map)
- <span style="color:red;">**The deadline to upload the projects is January 5th 2024, 23:59**</span>
- Libraries like Chart.js, Three.js, Google Maps and others will automatically disqualify your project. Everything must be built from scratch
- All JavaScript code must be provided in a **single .js file**
- Include in your archive all the required assets (images, json files etc.)
- Use **ONLY relative paths** to reference resources
- For people who worked as a team, a <ins>small .docx file</ins> which explains the contribution of each inspanidual is required
- The code will be uploaded on the platform by a single team member. **Do not** upload it multiple times.
- Any kind of plagiarism or fraud means an instant failure of the entire course
- The projects will be presented in **week 13** (the first one after the vacation)
- To be graded, a project must also be **presented by all the team members**. If failed to present, the members that were not part of the presentation won't have their project graded. More precisely, if you and other 2 colleagues worked on the same project, but one of your peers did not attend the presentation, you'll still get your grade, while your peer won't.
