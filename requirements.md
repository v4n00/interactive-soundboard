The deadline for choosing a project was met on October 15th. The final assignments can be found in the attached file. The symbols:
light green - you chose the project theme yourself and it's approved
light orange - you did not choose the project team yourself, so one theme was randomly assigned to you
dark orange - you written your name on a specific theme, but added a comment with another theme. The assigned theme is the one on column B.
A few considerations on the development of the project:

Use Visual Studio Code & Live Server to make development easier
The projects must contain at least 2 of the following APIs. Canvas API is mandatory.
Canvas
Audio API
Speech API
Video API
MIDI API
Geolocation API
Drag & drop API
Adding Bootstrap to your project is mandatory
You are not allowed to use any external libraries apart from Bootstrap, jQuery and Leaflet (for projects involving a map). Libraries like Chart.js, Three.js, Google Maps and others will automatically disqualify your project. Everything must be built from scratch.
All JavaScript code must be provided in a single .js file
Include in your archive all the required assets (images, json files etc.) 
Use ONLY relative paths to reference resources
For people who worked as a team, a small .docx file which explains the contribution of each individual is required
The deadline to upload the projects is January 5th 2024, 23:59
The code will be uploaded on the platform by a single team member. Do not upload it multiple times.
Any kind of plagiarism or fraud means an instant failure of the entire course
The projects will be presented in week 13 (the first one after the vacation)
To be graded, a project must also be presented by all the team members. If failed to present, the members that were not part of the presentation won't have their project graded
More precisely, if you and other 2 colleagues worked on the same project, but one of your peers did not attend the presentation, you'll still get your grade, while your peer won't
